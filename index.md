## Principal Roles
Mobile architect / Full Stack developer / SCRUM master

## Summary & Bio
Computer engineer with a Master in Web technologies. Specialized in **mobile application development**, with broad experience using **Agile methodologies** and **Certified Scrum Master**. Active [open source contributor](/open-source) and [blogger](/blog), with interest as well in backend development and machine learning.

I started my career as an Oracle trainee (2006-2007) developing internal applications for the sales department, where I was given with the "**Oracle's best trainee of the year**" award.

During 2007-2008 I started **my own company** and developed Open Doors, a web platform to connect neighboors, together with some other web applications for external customers.

In 2009 I joined [Mobivery](https://mobivery.com/) as the **Mobile lead** and **Scrum Master** of the team in Madrid, where we developed some of the most successful apps in the spanish AppStore and GooglePlay.
In April 2011, I moved to San Francisco (USA) and I worked as a mobile freelancer while studying, but after 9 months I decided to come back to Europe for personal reasons. 

In January 2012 I moved to Amsterdam (Netherlands) where I have worked at [Mobiquity](https://www.mobiquityinc.com/) as a **Senior iOS developer** and eventually as **iOS lead**.

In July 2016, I relocated back to Madrid and joined [Syltek](https://www.syltek.com/en/), to develop and **lead the [Playtomic](https://playtomic.io) mobile app**, a platform for booking sport courts.
